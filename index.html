                    Calisthenics - an art form in and of itself. The ultimate sport that brings enjoyment 
                    and people together. We partnered with Isaac Newton himself to develop groundbreaking research
                    for theories of gravity, and ways to bypass it. Currently, Newton has enabled various athletes to find a 
                    loophole. Newton's new law of gravity, called 'dark gravity', enables strong athletes to use their neuromuscular
                    strength to bypass the universal law of gravitation - once thought impossible, until Newton found out that the neuromuscular system can 
                    alter gravity under certain loads. Learn more about this research, or become a part of a new era of humanity. Sign up to participate, join our team.
